65xx_Library - ChipLabel part
==============================

## 1.0 About

![Component Example] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkeller0815/65xx_Library/master/img/label_demo.png)

For my own MOUSE project I've created some chip labels to make prototyping easier.

You can stick the lables on top of the components to have the names of the pins visible while connecting wires to them.

The SVG file (Chip_Label.svg) is the main file and can be edited with Inkscape (a vector based drawing tool)
(http://www.inkscape.org)

The PNG and PDF files are exported versions that are easier to print. 

## 2.0 NOTE

Under Mac OS X I had some problems using the files with the built in "preview" tool. The program acted really slow and the printout came out 
of my printer in a bad resolution. Using the Adobe Acrobat Reader for viewing and printing was much faster and with much better results.
