65xx_Library
============

## 1.0 About

Mainly this is an approach to create a KiCad Library for the most 65xx 
parts, like the 6502 CPU, the 6522 VIA and others.

There are also some useful chip labels for print out

KiCad can be found under:

This Library can be found in the KiCad folder

## 3.0 Chip Label

Additionally I've created some labels that can be glued on the top of an IC for easier wiring. 
The Labels are created as SVG file and exported to a PNG and PDF version. 

The folder "ChipLabel" contains the files.
